<p>For the image of the sky I thought that the contrasting colors of the sky compared to the city I was in was interesting and thought what would happen if I push the limits of the hues I picked. The cotton candy colors really pop and make you think about why we feel the way we feel about the things we see and what colors are assigned to them. What would we do if all our metal was a deep blue and suddenly all sky scrapers had extreme blue highlights within or on the outside</p>

<p>For the image of the plants I chose to darken it to highlight the bright colors of the plants. I like the way the filter made the red pop.</p>

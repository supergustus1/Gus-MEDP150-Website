<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In Susan Sontags In Platos Cave, She delves into the depths of perception in the example of Platos Cave. She also inquires onto the connection that one can be made between memory and photography viewed in the lens of Platos Cave. She speaks about the use of photography as evidence for us to remember things. She explains the replacement of lived experiences with photography, how everything can be depicted in a way that is much less personalized. I think this really speaks to the modern day issues seen in photography in terms of documentation of war and such. In media we can see so many wars being fought and casualties but at such a distance. We get to experience it while keeping a distance from our own person emotions. We get a window into the terrors of what is going on outside and when people, more specifically reporters who are forced to live it and in turn end up traumatized in one way or another. I think this is a really important thing to understand when thinking about photography and more the way we receive information to connect it more directly to the platos cave allegory. We, as in those who live in a first world country or at least a country not directly inside wartimes we prefer to watch the assumption of what is occurring in these war torn countries rather than face the truth and actually do something about it. Although it is important to understand that war and this level of documentation isnt as simple as just leaving the cave in Platos terms, there is a much deeper response and need for action to do things about it. I personally think this connection is the most important one to be made in times like this. There is also the important connection to my own lived experience of growing up in the age of the iPhone, having access to a camera since I was 7 years old has lead to a diminishing of my own mental imagery and memory. This is another important aspect to approach it from but far less of an immediate thing that needs to be addressed. These both are important issues though that attack the future of our society either in a way of the growth of our youth. Which I think is really the important thing to acknowledge because to connect it all together these issues are not something that plagued the initial generations introduced to photography as they lead healthy lives where they developed memories. Its more the way that we tend to use this technology. If you go to any concert you witness youth recording the experience rather than just taking in the music. I think ultimately this text is a warning to the future about how we use our increasingly intelligent technology to raise ourselves up apposing to dumbing ourselves down and desensitizing ourselves.

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>Nesrine Malik opens her article with the attention grabbing statement of two parallels that can be seen today in common media. I think something thats important to call notice to is that this isnt entirely a new experience. Although it is a much more terrifying reality than our predecessors had to deal with. Theres always been a level of propaganda in society. It can be traced to many societies where misinformation was being spread and it was up to the peoples to decide if it was the truth or if it was false. It became easier to distinguish as photography became more prevalent but photo editing has been around in many different ways for ages and it cant be overlooked that its always been something to overcome that we as a society have historically found ways to understand and work past. I think this particular time is definitely one where it poses the biggest threat as it reaches further levels of reality. Most elderly are unable to distinguish it as the author says which creates a giant disarray as more misinformation is allowed to spread easier due to its indistinguishability. Its important for us to think as a society what we can do to prevent this because AI has been around for a little while and even in the most egregious uses we can still see it fooling elderly and even just middle aged people. I for one know my parents consume this type of media without being aware of its effects despite them being in creative industries threatened by this too. There is the counter argument of them getting to know how to use it as well to further the creative industry as a whole and to not take too many people out of jobs. But this point is mute if all media gets taken over by government which is the next topic that the author gets to. She speaks about how radically misogynistic ai is in its roots and how its use in the far right party in America leads to the breaking down of all minorities. This is where we really need to look deep into how we allow media to be distributed and trusted. For example X formerly twitter used to have (or maybe still has) a feature called community notes which allowed trusted authorities to comment on the actual truth or meaning behind tweets. This would create a little bit of regulation in a way that doesnt censor people to spread information. This clearly isnt enough to keep us safe from it but its a good example that there are things that we can do to work on this. Propaganda isnt anything more than propaganda at the end of the day. Even with how real all of this is getting the messages that are being spread and information isnt truthful and anyone with simple access to the internet has the ability to get on top of any topic. Although this isnt entirely true with the increasing replacement of people googling this with just using AI. Which leads to the ability for misinformation to spread faster. All in all I fear this is just another level of propaganda that the new generation needs to learn to navigate as it cannot be used in an effective enough way to threaten a large enough number of people.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #003: <i>Motherhood stories</i></h3>
<p>I chose Heelas story for my motherhood story reflection. The first thing I think that is important is to understand the narrative and whats important to get the story across. The story being shared is one about a young woman who experiences rape and is impregnated as a result. She faces the choices of abortion which where she is located typically ends in the death of the individual doing it on themselves. She gets to get help for it and is eventually safe and freed but with the cost of not having her future ahead of her. She safely gives birth and is in a safe place to raise it but doesnt have the opportunity to go to school and advance herself. Now looking at this story visually the ability to tell this story solely through photographs would lead to one having little power over the narrative crafted since images can only tell so much about the difficulties that one is going through. On the other hand there is the narrative through text, which would leave out the ability to paint a direct picture of what the character is going through and how they physically experienced it. Narrative through text is typically most powerful within a fiction setting where the author is allowed to use creative text to build a picture in the readers mind but when its an actual life experience visual aid is always best added. This can even be witnessed in non fiction books where we often see visuals to accompany and aid our understanding. The cross between illustrations and text allows for us to get a visual that the author wants to paint directly without any room for creativity while allowing us to interpret text to fit within the narrative attempting to be written. I think the use of illustrations in combination with text, video, and pictures allows for an interesting narrative creatively while being based in a reality that anchors the story in a level of feeling more impactful to a viewer. For example to call back on the Platos Cave text by Susan Sontag, photography alone can allow us to desensitize ourself to lived experience where if we get a story accompanied by real pictures it allows us in a sense to live through it. I believe that there is no narrative that cant fit to every medium but I feel every single story can have a medium that suits it better. In the case of engagement with a realistic anchor this media achieved its best form in a multitude of art styles. The way you engage with a piece of media is heavily dependent on your own opinion of its specific art style its why we consider animation to be childish in most senses and movies to be the barest of bones reality we can achieve. A choice of meshing art styles together allows for a new experience that every reader may not have experienced before.</p>

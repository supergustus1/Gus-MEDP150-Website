<h1>Homework 4: Photomotage</h1>
<img src="images/Alcatraz Poster PhotoMotage 1.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For my photomontage, I decided to go in depth on the issues of the occupied land of the native Americans as I’ve recently gotten deep into reading from an author named Tommy orange. He speaks about something I realize I have very little information on. The occupation of Alcatraz a huge thing that I’ve apparently never been bothered to have been taught. I took my images from historical news pieces of the time as well as a few contemporary Native American voices who are speaking out on their behalf. I chose to use the blending layers to allow for you to see through the large texts and see that what makes up these stories happens to be real people and they are stories that we really should spend more time with.</p>

<p>For my second photomontage I chose to look into the dead internet theory. With the coming years of improvements of AI especially with the recently created Sora AI, most content creators and their original content can in theory be faked and this leads us closer to the idea of dead internet theory. The web will soon be run mostly by the ai creating the content and reacting to it within the comments. It is a scary future which I decided to depict by using some interesting technological imagery I found online. I tried to used extreme blending modes to acquire a contrasty dark extreme look to reflect my unhappiness for the upcoming future. Whether that is actually where we are headed or not I don’t particularly want to be someone to witness the death of creativity as a whole.</p>

<h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>
<h3>image 1</h3>
<img src="images/IMG_9556.JPG" width="400px">
<p>In this photo I went for a shallow depth of field by taking a photo of a wet floor sign from a distance with a little bit of an interesting background and by positioning the item near the center of the frame I acheived a shallow depth of field</p>
<br><br>
<h3>image 2</h3>
<img src="images/IMG_9557.JPG" width="400px">
<p>For this photo I went with the same composition but attempted to focus on the background and blur the wet floorsign in doing so I achieved a deep depth of field</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<h3>Edited Image 1</h3>
<img src="images/IMG_9556EDIT.jpg" width="400px">
<P>In this image, to acquire a deep depth of field I used a layer mask to select out the wet floor sign so I could add a blur effect and give the perception of deep depth of vision</P>
